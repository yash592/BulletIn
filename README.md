Start by installing front and backend dependencies if you have the patience. While in this directory, run the following commands:

```
yarn install
cd client
yarn install
cd ..
``

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```

```
yarn start
```

If you're still patient, start mongo locally

```
mongod
```

It's worth it. Enjoy!
