### A simple news app showing trending news based on topics/Countries and a brief gist of the article built on a slick UI. Perfect for on-the-go news as well as not falling for clickbaits.

```
v1 - App works ok locally. I'm aware of Heroku sign in problems and I'm trying to find a solution to it.
```

```
v2 - In development
```


------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------

Start by installing front and backend dependencies if you have the patience. While in this directory, run the following commands:

```
yarn install
cd client
yarn install
cd ..
``

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```

```
yarn start
```

If you're still patient, start mongo locally

```
mongod
```

It's worth it. Enjoy!

### Built on Mongo, Express, ReactJS, NodeJS.
